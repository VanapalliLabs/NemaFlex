Run "runall.m" with all the other MATLAB files in the same folder.
Variables are based on the microscopy setting (magnification, pixel size) 
and microfluidic device characterization (diameter and spacing) in the "runall.m" file.

r = skel2v4n(FileAVI,'magnification',4,'pixelsize',6.50,'diameter',40,'spacing',80,'verb',1);
